# JOB EXPERIENCE
1. **Hack Oregon, Data Analyst (volunteer)     Portland, OR| 2016-2017**
+ Pulled Portland Fire & Rescue dispatch data (900,000 rows) from a Postgresql database which sits in AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. Explored the data ranged from 2010 to 2016; calculated response time and visualized the analytical results in [Python Notebook](https://github.com/datascienceqing/PortlandFire).

2. **Molecular Testing Labs, Sr. Scientist      Vancouver, WA| 2013-2017**
+ Applied advanced SAS programming techniques such as Hash object, Pass through query/execute, Macros, and Debugger to optimize the procedures that were used to access data containing more than 1 million rows from various sources and produce datasets suitable for SAS analytics or reporting.
+ Created complex queries using SAS Enterprise Guide/PC SAS to extract and analyze data, as well as generate reports to track the performance of sales groups.
+ Used SAS to monitor the trends within the clinical trial project, spearheaded a data-driven methodology to identify gaps between current metrics and benchmarks and indicate corrective actions.
+ Analyzed user requirements and designed Data Mart Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) and gene mutation information. Load data through SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to construct a pharmaco-genomics knowledge database for reporting purpose.
+ Responded to doctors and communicated the benefits of Molecular Testing Labs' products in concise and informative reports.
+ Used Python to pull data from OpenFDA API, extracted Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) related gene information, and integrated into Lab Information System to generate ADR reports.
+ Performed data analysis for clinical trails. Organized data from 6 different assays and calculated AUC, cut-off, sensitivity, and specificity using lookups, pivot tables, and VBA.
+ Used Git for version control and R Markdown for documentation.

3. **Oregon Health and Science University, Sr. Research Associate  Portland, OR| 2008-2013**
+ Collaborated with international teams to identify more than 50 mutations that cause Neonatal Diabetes, published 10 peer-reviewed scientific papers.

# PROJECTS
1. **Medicare PartD data set analysis  May 2017**
+ Performed data analysis on Medicare PartD data set using SAS. Demonstrated beneficiaries distribution, drug usage among specialties and state, as well as changes of providers between 2013 and 2014.
+ Compared the opioid description among female and male doctors in different states.[Link](https://github.com/datascienceqing/MedicareParD)
2. **Find Lane Lines    Feb 2017**
+ Used Python OpenCV module and Sliding Window algorithm to detect and mark Lane Lines and calculate curvature.[Link]( https://youtu.be/1VN5ryqO5r0)
3. **Find vehicles    Mar 2017**
+ Used Python OpenCV and Scikit-learn modules as well as Sliding Window algorithm to identify vehicles, then applied Heat map algorithm to filter out false calls and mark correct bounding boxes.[Link](https://youtu.be/tOZhbInBmNU )
4. **Clone Human Driving Behavior   Feb 2017**
+ Built an Nvidia end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network using Keras library to drive car in a simulator. Collected 10-minute data on the simulator then used the data to train the model. The model can drive the simulator car autonomously.[Link](https://youtu.be/5R_c7XdWmZg)
5. **Classify Traffic Signs   Jan 2017**
+ Built a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow to classify traffic sign images in Python. Achieved 0.997 accuracy on 39,209 training images and 0.963 accuracy on 12,630 testing images.[Link](https://github.com/datascienceqing/Traffic-Sign-Classification-Project)
